                  <strong>Virus</strong> - By attaching to clean files, once
                  downloaded, viruses can infect other files and then spread
                  uncontrollably, damaging the core functionality of systems by
                  deleting or corrupting files.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Trojan</strong> (or Trojan Horse) - By disguising
                  itself as a legitimate software, once inside a network, a
                  Trojan can set up backdoor entries to allow other types of

                <li>
                  <strong>Worm</strong> - It infects the entire network or
                  device by replicating rapidly. As it spreads, a worm overloads
                  infected systems and may introduce other malware.

                  If sensitive information is collected on a large scale, cyber criminals may start a more targeted cyber attack such as spear phishing or business email compromise; these attacks rely on knowing more about the victim(s).
                </li>

                <li>
                  By using phishing emails to install malware on the victim's device, the infected device can be used to conduct more cyber attacks e.g, malicious emails sent from the infected device to colleagues or friends to infect their devices as well.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Cyber criminals may also use the information collected to access victims' bank accounts or trade the information on the Dark Web.
